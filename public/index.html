  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been working on the backend side of rails apps the past few months. One thing I&#8217;ve realized
is that you can go through a million tutorials but until you put those concepts to work you&#8217;ll have
a harder time grasping them.</p>

<p>Today I want to go over a very simple concept. This is applicable in many ways, especially when learning
to use different databases in a rails app. Today we&#8217;ll be covering installing a brand new rails app with
the postgreSQL database. Normally you&#8217;d have the SQLite db set up by default. There are numerous advantages
to this.. one being that heroku uses this&#8230; and if you&#8217;re installing your apps on heroku its nice to be
using the same database as heroku to avoid any potential issues that could come up relating to database configuration.</p>

<h1>Okay on to business&#8230;</h1>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Time to be Awesome </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rails new yourApp --database=postgresql</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s it. If you already have a rails app created and want to switch its still very straightforward.</p>

<p>1 Remove the sqlite gem from your gemfile
2 Add in the gem &#8216;pg&#8217; into your gemfile
3 run bundle
4 Then make sure your database.yml files are using the correct adapters. Here is an example</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Time to be Awesome </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>development:
</span><span class='line'>  adapter: postgresql
</span><span class='line'>  encoding: unicode
</span><span class='line'>  database: appname_development
</span><span class='line'>  pool: 5
</span><span class='line'>  username: your_system_username
</span><span class='line'>  password:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s it. You should be good to go. Of course you&#8217;ll need to make sure you have the PG installed on your system.
If you have homebrew you can do this easily</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Time to be Awesome </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew update
</span><span class='line'>  $ brew doctor
</span><span class='line'>  $ brew install postgresql</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first two commands make sure brew is up to date and healthy&#8230; the third is the command to install postgreSQL. That&#8217;s it.
This is something I would have found useful a few months ago so I figured I would include it here.</p>

<p>Enjoy and Be Awesome</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve made a dramatic change in my career over the past few months. I went from completely front end development to a focus on the full stack.
Throughout my career I have always dabbled a bit in the backend changing a few lines of codes in php and then uploading them to the server via ssh or ftp, but
this is a whole new ball game. Each day I experiment and learn something new. Its 100% frustrating but get this <strong> I love it </strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working as a web developer professionally since 2008, I was 19 then, and i&#8217;m 24 now. One thing I experienced that first year and a half of my
career was this extreme learning growth spurt. I remember being completely lost but eventually I would figure it out. It wasn&#8217;t always easy,
I had to develop with ie 6 compatability in mind, but at the end of the day I would always have a sense of accomplishment. I don&#8217;t want anyone to
think I stumbled upon this field with no knowledge I had a fundamental understanding of html and css and layouts back then before jumping in,
but it wasn&#8217;t until I jumped into developing site after site that I really started to exercise this knowledge and put it to the test.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I&#8217;ve been working as a full stack developer and I feel I&#8217;m back at the beginning of the learning cycle, but I think as developers
maybe that&#8217;s the most appropriate place for us to be. I speak from experience when I say its extermely easy to get stuck in this idea of a label. Were
a front end developer, or a designer, or a programmer. It takes a large amount of work and dedication to learning something new and its extremely
frustrating at first, and maybe always.. isn&#8217;t our job about solving problems&#8230; some we&#8217;ve never had to solve before, but eventually things get easier
and you start to grasp ideas you thought you were never going to grasp. Its a wonderful feeling to finally understand, and use , an idea that you&#8217;ve
been trying to grasp for a while.</p>

<p>I know this idea of always learning isn&#8217;t new at all, but its something I truly believe in. We don&#8217;t have to be the best or the smartest but if we
always strive to learn and improve I really think we&#8217;ll always have a job&#8230; an increasingly complex job at that. I think about a quote I heard first from a pretty
cool guy <a href="http://okdork.com/">Noah Kagen</a> &#8220;If its uncomfortable, you&#8217;re growing.&#8221;. I can&#8217;t tell you how often I think about that quote,
especially when learning what at first feels awkward like learning vim, using the terminal for everything, or learning ruby and then rails within a month
period&#8230; but its extremely true. Each day things feel less awkward, but its only because I&#8217;m learning and its the normal progression. I can&#8217;t wait
to get a bit more awkward just when I think I&#8217;ve learned it all :).</p>

<p>Be Awesome</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the constantly changing area of front end web development there may be a time when you have to at the very least understand the basics of a backend language such as ruby. I am going to use a language all front end developers should know&#8230; Javascript to help me and hopefully you understand the funadmentals of ruby&#8230; lets dig in.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love learning&#8230; I have since I was a kid. I remember my favorite time of the year was the summer. I was out of boring school
(yeah I realize the irony of not enjoying school but loving to learn)&#8230; and at least once a week my mom would drop me off at the library. I loved going to the library and reading. A funny thing started to happen the more I would learn and pick new skills up, I would discover there were a million things I still needed to learn.</div>
