    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I find it hard to blog about technical related issues. I feel most of the time everything I have to say has already been said but this is something i&#8217;ve found a lot of my peers especially at the current company I work at weren&#8217;t aware of&#8230; its a quick way to center an absolutely positioned element.<!-- more --></p>

<p>The only real requirement for this is you need to know the width of the element. Here is an example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#sampleDiv {
</span><span class='line'>  position: absolute;
</span><span class='line'>  top: 30%;
</span><span class='line'>  left: 50%;
</span><span class='line'>  margin-left: 225px;
</span><span class='line'>  width: 450px;
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s it&#8230; you position the element left 50 percent and then create a negative margin of 1/2 the width of the element, and it works.</p>

<p>I was surprised to know that this was something a few people I work with weren&#8217;t aware of so I thought I would share just in case anyone out there isn&#8217;t aware of this technique.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love learning&#8230; I have since I was a kid. I remember my favorite time of the year was the summer. I was out of boring school
(yeah I realize the irony of not enjoying school but loving to learn)&#8230; and at least once a week my mom would drop me off at the library. I loved going to the library and reading. A funny thing started to happen the more I would learn and pick new skills up, I would discover there were a million things I still needed to learn.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I still feel this way 10 years later. There is so much I don&#8217;t know but I love discovering and going down a new rabbit hole into another crazy world. Whether it was diving into the terminal for the first time or beginning to learn javascript and stop depending on a library&#8230; I have learned a lot but each time I start to feel confident I realize there&#8217;s a million things I still don&#8217;t know.</p>
