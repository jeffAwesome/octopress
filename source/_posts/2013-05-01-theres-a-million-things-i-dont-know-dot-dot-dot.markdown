I love learning... I have since I was a kid. I remember my favorite time of the year was the summer. I was out of boring school
(yeah I realize the irony of not enjoying school but loving to learn)... and at least once a week my mom would drop me off at the library. I loved going to the library and reading. A funny thing started to happen the more I would learn and pick new skills up, I would discover there were a million things I still needed to learn.<!-- more -->

I still feel this way 10 years later. There is so much I don't know but I love discovering and going down a new rabbit hole into another crazy world. Whether it was diving into the terminal for the first time or beginning to learn javascript and stop depending on a library... I have learned a lot but each time I start to feel confident I realize there's a million things I still don't know.
