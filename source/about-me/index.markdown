The generic run down is that I'm a front end engineer. I've been working professionally since 2008 I've been doing it even longer though for my high school and for fun. I am 23 years old and I am lucky to have over 5 years of real world experience. I currently work and reside in San Francisco.
I'm happily married and expecting my first and only child soon. Here's to hoping he's a coder :).



Now the not so generic run down.
When I was in the 8th grade I created my first web site using freewebs.com and I added google ads but with my mothers info, because after all you had to be 18 to get the money. Clever or not I thought hey I can have my classmates come to the site and help generate some cash for me by viewing my pages a lot, I was young and dumb ... well I got banned from google ads :(.

I started making money online through myspace layouts and I made a nice income while still in high school.

My junior year of high school, it was a small school around 300 students I created a social network for the school. I created it through a tool called Kick apps and within 3 days had several thousand views and eventually caused the site to be shut down by "the man".

I love everything about being a front end engineer. I love how our industry is always progressing. I love the ability to create something out of nothing. I'm obsessed with javascript and i'm obsessed with learning new things.
